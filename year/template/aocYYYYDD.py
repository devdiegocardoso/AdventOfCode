    Parse the puzzle input into a list of tuples.

    The puzzle input is expected to be a string containing pairs of values. 
    Each pair consists of a string followed by an integer. The function splits the input string, 
    converts the second value of each pair to an integer, and returns a list of tuples where the 
    first element of each tuple is the string and the second element is the corresponding integer.

    This function takes the puzzle input as input and returns the solutions for both 
    part one and part two of the puzzle. It first parses the puzzle input into a list 
    of numbers using the `parse` function. Then, it calculates the solution for part 
    one using the `part_one` function and the parsed numbers. Finally, it calculates 
    the solution for part two using the `part_two` function and the parsed numbers. 
    The solutions for both parts are returned as a tuple.

    Args:
        puzzle_input (str): The puzzle input to be solved.
